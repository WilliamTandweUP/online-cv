    summary: |
      I am a BSc Information Technology student who is passionate about coding. Coming from an IT background, I aspire to reach great heights 
      and make a statement in the world of computer science. I have been exposed to projects that are outside the realm of academics and 
      believe that because of that exposure I am well positioned to make my own mark on the IT industry.
